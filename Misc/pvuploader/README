README for pvuploader

This is alpha software, it just works for me...

To build the executable just run "make".

Create your LZH archives with "lha ao50" to make them compatible with
TextViewer or PVAddInManager.
To preserve the directory structure use "lha ao51".

You can then upload the archive to your PV with
(example for first serial port using 57600 baud)

  pvuploader --port=/dev/ttyS0 --baud=57600 --wakeup test.lzh

You can use the parameter "--append" to append archive contents to an
existing archive with the same name already installed on your
PV.

If you don't use "--wakeup" press the start button on your cradle (or
run the data-synchronisation addin on PV-S460/S660) after starting
pvuploader.

Note: you need the BootStrap patch (download from http://MCPVC.gmxhome.de)
installed on your PV to make this work!

Note: if you do not use "--append" an existing archive of the same
name will be overwritten!

Note: PVOS *is* case sensitive for filenames.

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me.

Have fun!
