This is a library which helps to communicate with a Casio PV.

This is a developer release!!

Use at your own risk.

If you compile it, there will be a binary called pvcasio. This is a little program to demonstrate what could be done with this library.
At the moment this program can only download data from the PV. The code for uploading is already here. But not useable with the pvcasio
executable.
I will try to make a better demo app which can also upload data, but at the moment it is only known how to add entries. It can not manipulate
nor delete entries.
If you want to see how this works take a look in the main.c
This Project is developed with KDeveloper. So if you have this IDE you can use it to take a deeper look.

If you haven't synced your PV with any other Applikation, the demo program might fail. The reason for this is unknown. Go sync your PV with
PCSync or AcroSync and it should work.

So to compile:
./configure
make

do not use make install at the moment, it doesn't make sense.

So have fun...
